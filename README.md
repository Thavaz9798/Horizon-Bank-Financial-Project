# Project Objective
Horizon bank is one of the bank which provides the lot of services to the customer like
loans to the customer in a different categories and here is the problem facing by the bank
because they provide huge amount loan to the customers but there is stuck in cash flow when
they return back the money from the customer , Most of the customers are payback the money

The loan and How many applicants we provide the loan, how much the average interest rate 
like these type of the confusion faced by the horizon bank and also, Want to see  all the things in 
the grid view in that includes all the KPI’s according to the grid view to make the data driven decision making and access the health of our loan port folio
# Summary Analysis
- In Summary Analysis we analyze the over all things
- The average loan interest rate, the number of loan applications we receive overall, the cost spent on the application, the amount we earn from the loan amount, and the average debt to income ratio
- We categorize items such as good and poor loans. For example, a good loan indicates that the amount has been paid in full, whereas a poor loan indicates that the amount has not been paid in whole. Keep an eye out for the bad loan.
- Next, we carefully examine the loan application and the amount that has been fully repaid to the bank, much like we do with the financed amount  Interset rate, amount received, and DTI (debt to income ratio)
# Loan Application Analysis
- This dashboard provides a detailed overview of bank loan applications, summarizing key metrics and trends related to loan applications by month, employee length, purpose, term, and house ownership status.
- Total Loan Applications: 38.6K with a month-to-date (MTD) growth of 4.3K and month-over-month (MOM) growth of 6.9%.
- Total Funded Amount: $435.8M, with MTD at $54.0M and MOM growth of 13.0%.
- Total Amount Received: $473.1M, with MTD at $58.1M and MOM growth of 15.8%.
- Average Interest Rate: 12.05%, with MTD at 13.5% and MOM at 10.3%.
- Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio: 13.33%, with MTD at 13.67% and MOM at 3.2%.
# Funded Amount Analayis
- This report provides an analysis of the total loan amount allocated across various categories. The categories include loan amounts by employee length, loan purpose, and house ownership status. The data highlights the distribution of loan funding to give insights into key areas such as the most funded purposes and employee demographics receiving loans.
-  The largest loan amount is allocated to employees with over 10 years of service, indicating higher credit allocation for individuals with longer work histories.
-  Credit card and debt consolidation purposes dominate loan funding, showing that a significant portion of funds is used for managing existing debt and credit obligations.
-  Mortgage holders receive the highest loan funding, indicating potential prioritization of borrowers with long-term housing commitments.
-  Further Analysis: Assess loan repayment performance across these categories to identify potential risk or high-performing segments.
-  Deeper Insights: Examine additional demographic or financial metrics, such as borrower income levels, to better understand credit allocation strategies.
# Received Amount Analysis
- This report provides an analysis of the total amount received in loan repayments across different dimensions such as month, employee length, purpose, term, and house ownership. This analysis offers valuable insights into repayment trends and the most common categories receiving payments.
-  Loan repayments gradually increase over the year, with a peak in December, possibly due to end-of-year financial activities or seasonal effects.
-  Loan repayments are highest among employees with a longer employment history, indicating a correlation between job stability and loan repayment amounts.
-  The bulk of received amounts are for debt consolidation and credit card purposes, emphasizing the high repayment activity in categories aimed at managing and reducing debt.
-  Loans with a 60-month term generate more repayments, possibly due to larger loan amounts or extended payment plans.
-   Mortgage holders contribute the largest repayment amounts, suggesting that borrowers with mortgages might have a stronger ability or need to make repayments.
